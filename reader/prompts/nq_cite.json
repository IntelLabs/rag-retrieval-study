It ended up debuting to just $2.6 million, finishing 12th at the box office and marking the lowest opening of the series. \"Deadline Hollywood\" noted the film suffered from being the third film of a trilogy and also said religious audiences saw the film as \"a cash grab and not a movie promoting a Christian message anymore\", and were more inclined to go to other faith-based films in theaters like \"I Can Only Imagine\" and \"Paul, Apostle of Christ\". It fell 58% in its second weekend to $1.1 million, finishing 17th. By the end of its North American run the film grossed a total of $5.5 million, less than other two films grossed simply in their opening weekends ($9.7 million and $7.6 million, respectively).\n"
